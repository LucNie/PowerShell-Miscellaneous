## outiles Npm
Place the script at the same level as your node js project parents.
The script will simply do an `npm install` to all folders or remove "node-modules" as desired.

### UPDATE
I deleted some scripts that had become obsolete, mostly due to my previous lack of experience. New ones will be arriving soon

## Kill static process
kill windows 7/8/10/11 processes by name and by how long they are running.
